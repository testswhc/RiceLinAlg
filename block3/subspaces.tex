\beginedxvertical{Criteria for being a Subspace}

\doedxvideo{Subspace Criteria}{pQWBhzg_6Bc}

\beginedxtext{Subspaces}

{\keya{\bf{Definition.}}}  
Suppose $V$ is a vector space over a field $F$.  A subset $W \subset V$ is a {\keyb{\bf{subspace}}}  
of $V$ if $W$ is a vector space over $F$ in its own right, using the same vector operations as in $V$.  

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  
A subset $W$ of a vector space $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$W$ is closed under addition; that is, for all vectors $w_1,w_2 \in W$, the sum $w_1+w_2$ is also an
element of $W$.  
\item
$W$ is closed under scalar multiplication; that is, for any vector $w\in W$ and scalar $a \in F$, the
product $aw$ is also an element of $W$.  
\item
$W$ contains $\veco$.  
\end{itemize}

\beginedxvertical{Subspace Examples}



\beginedxproblem{First Quadrant}{\dpa1}

Let $W$ be the set of vectors in $\R^2$ which lie in (or on the boundary of) the first quadrant.  
That is,
\[ W = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array} \right] : x_1, x_2 \ge 0\right\}. \]



\begin{center}
\includesvg[300]{c3s1subspace1}   
\end{center}

Is $W$ closed under addition?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $W$ closed under scalar multiplication?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Does $W$ contain the zero vector?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $W$ a subspace of $\R^2$?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{ $W$ contains $\veco$ and is closed under vector addition, but if you scale
a vector such as $\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]$ in $W$ by, say, $-2$, the result
is not in $W$.  Thus $W$ is not closed under scalar multiplication and is not a subspace of $\R^2$.  
 }
 
\endedxproblem


\beginedxproblem{First and Third Quadrant}{\dpa1}

Let $U$ be the set of vectors in $\R^2$ which lie in (or on the boundary of) the first quadrant or
the third quadrant.  
That is,
\[ U = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{array} \right] : x_1, x_2 \ge 0 \ \mathrm{or} \ x_1,x_2 \le 0\right\}. \]

\begin{center}
\includesvg[300]{c3s1subspace2}   
\end{center}

Is $U$ closed under addition?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Is $U$ closed under scalar multiplication?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Does $U$ contain the zero vector?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $U$ a subspace of $\R^2$?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{ $U$ contains $\veco$ and is closed under scalar multiplication, but if you add
$\left[ \begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]$ to 
$\left[ \begin{array}{c} -1 \\ -3 \end{array} \right]$, the result
is not in $U$.  Thus $U$ is not closed under addition and is not a subspace of $\R^2$.  
 }
 
\endedxproblem


\beginedxproblem{Diagonal Line}{\dpa1}

Let $Y$ be the set of vectors in $\R^2$ which lie on the line $x_1 = x_2$
That is,
\[ Y = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} c \\ c \end{array} \right] : c \in \R \right\}. \]

\begin{center}
\includesvg[300]{c3s1subspace3}   
\end{center}

Is $Y$ closed under addition?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $Y$ closed under scalar multiplication?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Does $Y$ contain the zero vector?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $Y$ a subspace of $\R^2$?  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{ If you add or scale vectors in $Y$, the result is still in $Y$.  $Y$ also contains
the zero vector.  Thus $Y$ is a subspace of $\R^2$.

\beginedxproblem{Horizontal Plane}{\dpa1}

Let $Z$ be the set of vectors in $\R^3$ whose third coordinate is -1.  
That is,
\[ Z = \left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ -1 \end{array} \right] : x_1, x_2 \in \R \right\}. \]

\begin{center}
\includesvg[300]{c3s1subspace5}   
\end{center}

Is $Z$ closed under addition?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Is $Z$ closed under scalar multiplication?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Does $Z$ contain the zero vector?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Is $Z$ a subspace of $\R^2$?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{ 
This is one where you have to remember that the vectors contained in $Z$ are not the arrows that lie {\emph{"along"}} the pictured set, but rather are the points within the set (or the arrows that are based at the
origin and end in the set).  For instance,  $\left[ \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]$ and 
$\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]$ are elements of $Z$, but their sum is not.

\edXabox{expect="True" options="True","False"}

of $V$.  If $V$ is non-zero, then these two subspaces are different from one another.
