Yes. The only acceptable row operations are multiplication by a scalar, addition, and subraction. In the case of a matrix with real entries, row-reducing will not require a non-real scalar. The sum, product and difference of two real numbers is also real. Thus, under each of these operations, the entries will remain real.  </p>
