If a matrix has rational number entries, will the entries stay rational numbers when you row-reduce it? (Recall that rational numbers are those that can be written as fractions [mathjaxinline]\frac{p}{q}[/mathjaxinline], where [mathjaxinline]p,q[/mathjaxinline] are integers.) </p>

Yes. The only acceptable row operations are multiplication by a scalar, addition, and subraction. In the case of a matrix with rational entries, row-reducing will not require a non-rational scalar. The sum, product and difference of two rational numbers is also rational. Thus, under each of these operations, the entries will remain rational.  </p>
