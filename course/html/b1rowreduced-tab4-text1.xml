  <p>
The following algorithm will always work to reduce a matrix into Row-Reduced Echelon Form. </p>
  <ul class="itemize">
    <li>
      <p>
Swap two rows to get the left-most remaining non-zero entry to the topmost remaining row. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
Scale that row to make its leading entry a 1. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
Clear all non-zero entries in the column of that pivot (both above and below the pivot) by adding/subtracting multiples of that row to/from other rows. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
With that pivot now set, repeat the procedure with the remaining rows. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
This is sometimes called <span style="color:#99182C"><b class="bf">Gaussian elimination</b></span>. </p>
