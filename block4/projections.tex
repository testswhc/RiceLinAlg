At the end of this sequence, and after some practice, you should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the geometric properties of orthogonal projections.  
\item Compute orthogonal projections.  
\item Apply the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm to find orthogonal bases. 
\end{itemize}

For time budgeting purposes, this sequence has 4 videos totaling 14 minutes, 
plus some questions.

\beginedxvertical{Introducing Projections}


\beginedxproblem{Closest Vector}{\dpa1}

Consider the vector $v = 
 \left[\begin{array}{c}
3 \\
4 \\
7
\end{array} \right] \in \R^3$.  Let $W$ be the subspace of $\R^3$ given by 
\[ W = \left\{  \left[\begin{array}{c}
a_1 \\
a_2 \\
0
\end{array} \right] : a_1, a_2 
in \R \right\}. \]
(In other words, $W$ is the $x-y$ plane inside $\R^3$.)  What is the closest vector to $v$ inside $W$?

\beginedxproblem{Remembering the Conditions}{\dpa1}

True or false: If $\{w_1; w_2;  \ldots w_k\}$ is an orthogonal basis of the 
subspace $W \subset V$, and $v\in V$, then the orthogonal projection of $v$ onto $W$ is given by 
$\ds \sum_{i=1}^k \langle v, w_i \rangle w_i$.

\doedxvideo{Orthogonal Projections with Orthogonal Basis}{???}


\beginedxtext{Orthogonal Projection Theorem}

Let $V$ be a vector space with an inner product, and let $v\in V$.  

If $\{w_1; w_2; \ldots w_k\}$ is an orthogonal basis of a subspace $W$, then 
the vector 
\[ \hat{v} = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\langle v, w_i \rangle}{\langle w_i, w_i \rangle} w_i \]
is the {\keyb{\bf orthogonal projection}} of $v$ onto $W$, sometimes denoted $\mathrm{Proj}_W (v)$,
and has the following properties: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\hat{v} \in W$.
\item $v - \hat{v}$ is orthogonal to every vector in $W$. 
\item $\hat{v}$ is the unique vector having the previous two properties.  
\item $\hat{v}$ is the closest vector to $v$ in $W$.  
\end{enumerate}

Let $W$ be the subspace of $\R^4$ spanned by the list $\{w_1; w_2; w_3\}$, where 
$w_1 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 
\end{array} \right]$, $w_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 
\end{array} \right], $ and $w_3 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 
\end{array} \right]. $  Note that $\{w_1; w_2; w_3\}$ is an orthogonal list.  

Let $v = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 2 \\ -3 \\ 4 
\end{array} \right].$  What is the closest vector to $v$ in $W$?

\beginedxproblem{Projection Practice 2}{\dpa1}

Recall that $C[0,1]$ is the vector space of continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$, and that
we have an inner product on that vector space given by $\langle f, g \rangle = \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) \ dx$.  


Let $W$ be the subspace of $C[0,1]$ which is the span of a single function 
$f(x) = x$.  

Let $g(x) = x^2$.  What is the orthogonal projection of $g$ onto $W$?
