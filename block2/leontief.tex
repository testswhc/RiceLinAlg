\beginedxtext{Preliminaries}




The goal of this sequence is to introduce an application of matrix algebra to economics, called the Leontief
Input-Output Model.  This will not be covered on the midterm.  


For time budgeting purposes, this sequence has 1 videos totaling 12 minutes, 
plus some questions.

\beginedxvertical{Using Gasoline}

\beginedxproblem{A Race}{\dpa1}

There's going to be a cross-country auto race in the Namib Desert (sort of like Mad Max)!  There are expected to be
1000 cars participating, each of which will travel 600 miles.  In this terrain, each car is only
able to travel 2 miles per gallon of gasoline.
  
How much gasoline will be required to put this race on?  

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="$>300000$ gallons" options="$\le 100,000$ gallons","$>100,000$ but $\le 200,000$ gallons","$>200,000$ but $\le 300,000$ gallons","$>300000$ gallons"}

\edXsolution{ See the next video!
