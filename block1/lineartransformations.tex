What is the codomain of $T$?

\edXsolution{ 
$A$ has 3 columns. Therefore, for the product $Ax$ to be defined, $x$ must have 3 rows, and will be a vector in $\R^3$. \\
Since $A$ has two rows, the product $Ax$ will be a vector in $\R^2$.

\beginedxvertical{Linear Transformation Definition}

\beginedxtext{Definition of Linear Transformation}

{\keya{\bf{Definition.}}} 
Let $V,W$ be vector spaces over a field $F$.    A function $T: V\rightarrow W$ is a {\keyb{\bf linear transformation}}
if both of the following properties hold:

\begin{itemize}
\item For any vectors $v, w$ in the domain, $T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w).$ 
\item For any vector $v$ in the domain, and any scalar $a\in F$, $T(av) = aT(v)$.    
\end{itemize}

Informally, if $T$ satisfies the first condition we say that ``$T$ respects vector addition", and 
if $T$ satisfies the second condition we say that ``$T$ respects scalar multiplication."

\beginedxvertical{Some Examples and Non-examples}



\beginedxproblem{Linear Transformation? 1}{\dpa1}

Define $T: \R^3 \rightarrow \R^3$ by $T(v) = 2v$.  

Does $T$ respect vector addition?  That is, is $T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w)$ for all 
vectors $v,w$?
Try a couple of specific numerical examples if you're not sure.  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Does $T$ respect scalar multiplication?  
That is, is $T(av) = aT(v)$ for all vectors $v$ and scalars $a$?
Try a couple of specific numerical examples if you're not sure.  


\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $T$ a linear transformation?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ 

It appears that the transformation is linear. We can prove it with algebra: \\

We have $T(v + w) = 2(v+w) = 2v + 2w = T(v) + T(w)$.  Therefore $T$ respects vector addition.  

Similarly $ T(av) = 2(av) = a(2v) =  aT(v),$ so $T$ respects scalar multiplication.  Thus, 
$T$ is a linear transformation.

\beginedxproblem{Linear Transformation? 2}{\dpa1}

Define $T: \R^2 \rightarrow \R^2$ by $T(v) = \veco$.  

Does $T$ respect vector addition?  That is, is $T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w)$ for all 
vectors $v, w$?
Try a couple of specific numerical examples if you're not sure.  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $T$ a linear transformation?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ 

$T(v+w) = \veco = \veco + \veco = T(v) + T(w)$, so $T$ respects addition.  
Also, 
$T(av) =  \veco = a\veco = aT(v)$, so $T$ respects scalar multiplication.  

Hence $T$ is a linear transformation.

\end{array} \right]$.

Is $T$ a linear transformation?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ 
Here, trying specific vectors provides a counterexample, which is sufficient to show that $T$ is not a linear transformation.\\
Let $v_1 = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
1\\2\\5 
\end{array} \right]$, 
$v_2 = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
-4\\0\\9 
\end{array} \right]$\\
$T(v_1) + T(v_2) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] 
+  \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]  
=  \left[\begin{array}{c} 8 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]$\\
Meanwhile, $T(v_1 + v_2) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]$.
$T$ does not respect vector addition and is not linear.\\

We also see that 
$8T(v_1) = 8 \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] 
= \left[\begin{array}{c} 32 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]$\\
Meanwhile, $T(8v_1) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 4 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]$.
$T$ does not respect scalar multiplication; this on its own would also be enough to know that $T$ is not linear.

\beginedxproblem{Linear Transformation? 4}{\dpa1}

Define $T: \mathbb{P} \rightarrow \R$ by $T(f) = f(1)$.  

To get a sense of how $T$ works, let's do a quick example.  Suppose $f$ is the element of 
$\mathbb{P}$ given by $f(t) = 2t^2 -5$.  
What is $T(f)$?  

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="-3"}


Does $T$ respect vector addition?  That is, is $T(f+g) = T(f) + T(g)$ for all 
vectors $f,g \in \mathbb{P}$?
Try a couple of specific numerical examples if you're not sure.  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Does $T$ respect scalar multiplication?  
That is, is $T(af) = aT(f)$ for all vectors $f \in \mathbb{P}$ and scalars $a$?
Try a couple of specific numerical examples if you're not sure.  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

Is $T$ a linear transformation?

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ 
$T$ respects vector addition because:\\
$f(1) + g(1) = (f+g)(1)$\\
i.e. we can evaluate polynomials at 1 separately and add the results, or we can add the polynomials and evaluate the result at 1, and we'll get the same result.

% This must be true in general for all polynomials $f$ and $g$. We can test this with some specific examples, but we give a (somewhat sketchy) proof here.\\ Suppose $f$ and $g$ contain no like terms between them. Then the right side of the equation, the evaluation of $f+g$ at 1, would be calculated by evaluating the terms of $f$ and $g$ separately and then adding the results, which is precisely the left hand side of the equation. Otherwise, $f$ and $g$ contain like terms, and for any two terms $ax^n$ and $bx^n$ belonging to $f$ and $g$ respectively, $a(1^n) + b(1^n) = a + b = (a+b)(1^n)$.\\
$T$ respects scalar multiplication because:\\
$cT(f) = cf(1) = (cf)(1) = T(cf)$\\
i.e. we can evaluate a polynomial at 1 and multiply the result by a scalar, or multiply the polynomial by the scalar first and then evaluate the result at 1, and we'll get the same result. 

% Again, it is simple to try some examples to observe this, but we can also prove it.\\
% Suppose $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x_{n-1} + ... a_1x + a_0$. Then $cf(1) = c(a_n + ... + a_0) = ca_n + ca_{n-1} + ... + ca_0 = (cf)(1)$.

\beginedxproblem{Linear Transformation Practice}{\dpa1}

Suppose $T: \mathbb{P} \rightarrow \R^2$ is a linear transformation.  Let $f,g\in \mathbb{P}$ be
the polynomials given by $f(t) = t^2$ and $g(t) = t$.  

Suppose that $T(f) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2  \end{array} \right]$
and $T(g) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ -1  \end{array} \right]$

If $j \in \mathbb{P}$ is the polynomial given by $h(t) = 3t^2-t$, what must $T(j)$ be?



\edXabox{type="custom" cfn="VectorEntry" expect="[[1],[7]]"}


\edXsolution{ 
We are assured that $T$ is a linear transformation, so we have: 
\[T(h) = T(-2t^2)  = -2T(t^2) = -2T(f) = -2\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2  \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} -2 \\ -4  \end{array} \right]. \]

Also, 
\[T(j) = T(3t^2-t) = T(3t^2) + T(-t) = 3T(t^2) + -T(t) = 3T(f) - T(g) = 3\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2  \end{array} \right] - \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ -1  \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 7  \end{array} \right]. \]
