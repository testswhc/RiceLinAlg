\beginedxvertical{RREF Defined}

\beginedxtext{Row-Reduced Echelon Form}


A matrix is in Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF) if it satisfies the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item All rows of all zeros are at the bottom.
\item In any non-zero row, the first non-zero entry is 1.  (This is called a {\keyb{\bf pivot}}.) 
\item Each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column.
\item A pivot in a lower row is to the right of any pivot in a higher row.  
\end{itemize}

\beginedxproblem{Make it RREF}{\dpa2}

The following matrix is not in RREF.


$\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 7 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & -2 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
 \end{array} \right]$

However, you can apply a single row operation to put it into RREF.  What matrix is the
result?  


\input{matrixentry.tex}

\edXabox{type="custom" cfn="MatrixEntry" expect="[[1,4,0,0,7],[0,0,1,0,5],[0,0,0,1,1]]"}

\edXsolution{Note that the matrix currently satisfies all conditions except ``Each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column", for there is a $-2$ above the pivot in the third row.  We can add two times row three to row two and replace row 2 with the result.  Doing so, we obtain

$\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 7 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 5 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
 \end{array} \right].$}

\beginedxproblem{Pivots vs. Rows}{\dpa2}

True or False: If a matrix that is in RREF has 6 rows, then it must have 6 pivots.  


\edXabox{expect="False" options="True","False"}

\edXsolution{In fact, a matrix with $6$ rows may have any number of pivots between $0$ and $6$.  For example, the $6\times 6$ zero matrix has 6 rows, and zero pivots, while the $6\times 6$ matrix  $\left[ \begin{array}{cccccc} 
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0&0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0&0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0&0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0&0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1&0 \\

\doedxvideo{The Row Reduction Algorithm}{oXO9Iw9KyPo}



\beginedxtext{The Row-Reduction Algorithm}

The following algorithm will always work to reduce a matrix into Row-Reduced Echelon Form.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Swap two rows to get the left-most remaining non-zero entry to the topmost remaining row.  
\item Scale that row to make its leading entry a 1.    
\item Clear all non-zero entries in the column of that pivot (both above and below the pivot) by adding/subtracting multiples of that row to/from other rows.  
\item With that pivot now set, repeat the procedure with the remaining rows.  
\end{itemize}

This is sometimes called {\keyb{\bf  Gaussian elimination}}.

\beginedxvertical{Row-Reducing Practice}


\beginedxproblem{Row-reduction Practice}{\dpa1}

Let 
\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 0 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \\ 0 & -2 & 1\end{array} \right]. \]

What matrix do you get if you row-reduce $A$? 

\input{matrixentry2.tex}

\edXabox{type="custom" cfn="MatrixEntry" expect="[[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,0]]"}

\edXsolution{ \begin{itemize}
\item Swap two rows to get the left-most remaining non-zero entry to the topmost remaining row.  
\item Scale that row to make its leading entry a 1.    
\item Clear all non-zero entries in the column of that pivot (both above and below the pivot) by adding/subtracting multiples of that row to/from other rows.  
\item With that pivot now set, repeat the procedure with the remaining rows.  
\end{itemize}

\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 0 & -3 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \\ 0 & -2 & 1\end{array} \right]. \]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Swap R1 and R2:
    \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 0 & -3 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \\ 0 & -2 & 1\end{array} \right]. \]
    
    \item Scale the new R1 by $\frac{1}{3}$:
     \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 2 & 5 \\ 0 & -2 & 1\end{array} \right]. \]
     
     \item Subtract twice R1 from R3 and replace R3 to clear the non-zero entry below the pivot in the first row:
     \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 2 & 7 \\ 0 & -2 & 1\end{array} \right]. \]
     
    \item We focus on the remaining rows.  The left-most nonzero entries are in row 2 and 3, and the leading entry of the second row is already 1, so we do not need to perform any swap or scaling to satisfy the conditions in the first and second step of the algorithm.\\
    Now, we clear the non-zero entry in the third row below this pivot by replacing R3 with R3$-2\cdot$R2.  We also clear the non-zero entry in the fourth row below this pivot by replacing R4 with R4$+2\cdot $R2.
     \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 5\end{array} \right]. \]
     \item Now, the first left-most non-zero entry is already in the topmost remaining row (row 3), so we scale it by $\frac{1}{3}$ to obtain
     \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 5\end{array} \right]. \]
     \item Finally, we clear the non-zero entries above and below that pivot by replacing R1 with R1$+$R3, replacing R2 with R2$-2\cdot$R3 and replacing R4 with R4$-5\cdot$R3.
     \[\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0\end{array} \right]. \]
     
\end{itemize}
We can then check that this final matrix satisfies the conditions of RREF.  Applying the algorithm to this final matrix will not require any row operations.

\beginedxproblem{Linear System 1}{\dpa1}

Consider the augmented matrix
\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc:c} 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 3 & 0 & -3 & 3 \\ 
2 & 2 & 5 & 3\\ 0 & -2 & 1 & 7\end{array} \right]. \]


Note that the coefficient matrix is the same as the matrix $A$ from the previous question.

Applying the row-reduction algorithm to this augmented matrix, what can we conclude about
the system?  

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="The system is consistent and has a unique solution" options="The system is consistent and has a unique solution","The system is consistent but has more than one solution","The system is inconsistent"}

\edXsolution{After repeating the first 3 steps from above to this matrix, we obtain
\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 
0 & 2 & 7 & 1\\ 0 & -2 & 1 & 7\end{array} \right]. \].

Repeating step 4, we obtain

\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 3 & 3\\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 5\end{array} \right]. \].

Repeating step 5, we obtain
\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 5 & 5\end{array} \right]. \].

And, finally, repeating step 6, we obtain

\[
A = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc:c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -3 \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array} \right]. \].

This represents the equations $x_1 = 2$, $x_2 = -3$, $x_3 = 1$, and $0=0$.  Thus there is a unique
solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (2,-3,1)$.

\edXsolution{The second row corresponds to an equation of the form $0x+0y=1$, which has no solutions.  Thus, the original system will also have no solutions.  This is true even though the second column has no pivot

\edXsolution{The original system corresponds to 3 equations in 2 variables.  Since there are two pivot positions in the RREF and 2 variables, we can conclude that there are $2-2=0$ free variables.  Thus, the original system is consistent and has a unique solution.

\edXsolution{The original system corresponds to 3 equations in 4 variables.  Since there are 2 pivot positions in the RREF, there are $4-2=2$ free variables.  Since there is no row of zeros followed by a non-zero entry,
the system is consistent, but the existence of free variables ensures that any solution to the system is not unique.

Type the word `free' (lower-case) if the variable is a free variable.  For others, remember to use * for times and type

\edXsolution{Working from right to left, we first see that there is not a pivot in the column corresponding the $x_4$.  Thus, $x_4$ is free.  We then see a pivot in the column corresponding to $x_3$, and corresponding equaion is $0x_1+0x_2+1x_3+3x_4=3$.  This gives $x_3=3-3x_4$.  Next, there is not a pivot in the column corresponding to $x_2$, and thus $x_2$ is free.   Finally, there is a pivot in the column corrsponding to $x_1$ and the corresponding equation is $1x_1+0x_2+0x_3+1x_4=-2$.  This gives $x_1=-2-x_4$.

A {\keyb{\bf field}} is, essentially, a set in which one can add, subtract, multiply, and

The field that we will

the set of complex numbers $\C$, the set of rational numbers $\Q$, and the integers modulo
a prime $p$.  

\begin{edXshowhide}{Formal Definition of a Field}
A field is a set $F$ together with binary operations $+, \cdot$ on $F$ which satisfy the
following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Addition is associative and commutative; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, we have
$a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c$ and $a+b  = b+a$.  
\item There is an element $0 \in F$ such that $a+0 = a$ for all $a \in F$.
\item For every $a\in F$, there is an element $-a \in F$ such that $-a + a = 0$.  
\item Multiplication is associative and commutative; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, we have
$a(bc) = (ab)c$ and $ab  = ba$.  
\item There is a non-zero element $1 \in F$ such that $1a = a$ for all $a \in F$.  
\item For every non-zero $a\in F$, there is an element $a\inv$ such that $a\inv a = 1$.  
\item Multiplication distributes over addition; that is, for all $a,b,c \in F$, $a(b+c) = ab + ac$.
