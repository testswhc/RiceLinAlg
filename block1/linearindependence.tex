\beginedxvertical{Linear Independence}


\beginedxproblem{Existence vs. Uniqueness}{\dpa1}

Given a matrix $A$, consider the equation $Ax = \veco$.   

Regarding such equations, we have discussed two main questions: the existence question
(does there exist at least one solution?) and the uniqueness question (is there at most one
solution?).  For this equation, one of these questions always has the same answer, no matter
what $A$ is.  Which question does not always have the same answer?  

\edXabox{expect="Uniqueness" options="Existence","Uniqueness"}

\edXsolution{Because $A\veco = \veco$ always, the answer to the existence question is always "yes" for this equation. It's not always the case, however, that the zero vector is the only solution; for some matrices, some other combination of the columns of $A$ will also give zero. 
% When a matrix $A$ does in fact have a unique solution to $Ax = \veco$, that makes $A$ a special type of matrix, as we'll see in this section.

Which of these is the definition of linearly dependent?  

A list of vectors $\{v_1; v_2; \ldots v_n\}$ is linearly dependent if...

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="...there exist scalars
$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$, not all zero, such that $a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_nv_n = \veco$." options="...there exist scalars
$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$, not all zero, such that $a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_nv_n = \veco$.","...there exist scalars
$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$, all not zero, such that $a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_nv_n = \veco$.","Both of these are the definition."}

\edXsolution{ 
We know that if all the scalars equal zero, the equation $a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots a_nv_n = \veco$ will be true. The idea of linear dependence is that we can choose a different set of scalars that also makes the equation true; i.e., a set of scalars that is not all zeros. (They may very well be all non-zero scalars, but this is not required.)

\edXsolution{ Choice B has the zero vector and is therefore linearly dependent. Choice C has 5 vectors in $\R^4$ and is therefore linearly dependent (expressed as a matrix, there would be more columns than rows). Choice E has a pair of collinear vectors: the third vector is twice the second vector. The list in choice E is therefore linearly dependent.
