\[ A = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} | & | & & | \\ 
v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n \\

\beginedxproblem{Where does it live?}{\dpa1}

Suppose $A$ is a $6\times 4$ real matrix.  In order for the product $Ax$ to be defined, the vector $x$ must live
in what space?  


\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="$\R^4$" options="$\R^4$","$\R^6$","Either of these is fine"}

The resulting product $Ax$ will be an element of which space?  

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="$\R^6$" options="$\R^4$","$\R^6$","Either of these is fine"}

\edXsolution{ 

For the matrix-vector product to be defined, the number of columns of the first matrix must equal the number of entries in the vector (otherwise, the mechanics just don't work). Our matrix $A$ has 4 columns, so $x$ must then live in $\R^4$. \\
Furthermore, if a matrix-vector product is defined, the result will have the same number of rows as the matrix. Our product $Ax$ will therefore  be a vector living in $\R^6$.

\beginedxproblem{Products and Spans}{\dpa1}

     

True or false: If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix
\[ A = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} | & | & & | \\ 
v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n \\
 | & | & & | \end{array} \right], \]

\edXsolution{ 

The span of a list of vectors is the set of all linear combinations of those vectors. 
$Ax$ is defined to be a linear combination of the columns of $A$, and so it is in the span of those columns.

We will row reduce the augmented matrix: \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 2\\ 3 & -1 & 16 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
Multiply the first row by -1, and add this to the second row: \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -1\\ 3 & -1 & 16 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
Multiply the first row by -3, and add this to the third row: \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -1\\ 0 & -7 & 7 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
Multiply the second row by 7, and add this to the third row: \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -1\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
Multiply the second row by -2, and add this to the first row: \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 1 & -1\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
Our vector $x$ is given by the last column. \\ \\
We can perform the same steps to answer the second question:\\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & -4\\ 3 & -1 & 7 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -7\\ 3 & -1 & 7 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -7\\ 0 & -7 & -2 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
$ \left[\begin{array}{cc:c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & -7\\ 0 & 0 & -51 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
We can stop here. The last row of the augmented matrix implies the equation $x_1 \cdot 0 + x_2 \cdot 0 = -51$, which has no solution. Therefore, the original equation has no solution.

\beginedxproblem{Non-trivial Solutions}{\dpa1}

Let $A$ be a $6\times 4$ matrix.  The equation $Ax = \veco$ has the solution $x = \veco$, which we
call the  {\keyb{\bf trivial solution.}}  If there are no solutions other than the trivial solutions,
how many pivots must $A$ have when row-reduced?  


\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="4"}

\edXsolution{ 
The vector $x$ lives in $\R^4$, so there are four variables in this equation.  If the trivial solution is
the unique solution, then we cannot have free variables when the augmented
matrix $\left[ \begin{array}{c:c} A & \veco \end{array} \right]$ is row-reduced.  That means $A$ will have
a pivot in each of its four columns.  
%  
% Suppose matrix $A$ has fewer than 4 pivots when row-reduced. Since the number of free variables in an equation equals the number of variables minus the number of pivots, we would then have a positive number of free variables. \\ \\ 
% e.g.: \\
% $\left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1&0&0&-2  \\  0&1&0&1 \\ 0&0&1&5 \\ 0&0&0&0 \\ 0&0&0&0 \\ 0&0&0&0    \end{array} \right] \cdot  \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{array} \right]  = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] $ \\ \\
% Suppose this is our result upon row reducing our matrix $A$. It is convenient here to declare that $x_4$ is the free variable. We can choose any value we like for $x_4$, and substitute to solve for the others. (If we choose $x_4 = 0$, we get the trivial solution for $x$.) In this way, we would have infinitely many solutions to the equation. \\ \\
% Since it is given that only the trivial solution exists, we therefore can't have fewer than 4 pivots, and since more than 4 is impossible in a 6 x 4 matrix, we must have exactly 4.

%requires new grading program

\edXabox{expect="Placeholder" options="Placeholder"}

\edXsolution{ 
We row reduce the matrix $A$: \\ \\
$\left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\  5 & 6 & -1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$ \\ \\
Multiply the first row by -5, and add this to the second: \\ \\
$\left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\  0 & 1 & -1 & 6 \end{array} \right]$ \\ \\
Multiply the second row by -1, and add this to the first: \\ \\
$\left[ \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 1 & -7 \\  0 & 1 & -1 & 6 \end{array} \right]$ \\ \\
Ordinarily, to solve a matrix equation, we would row reduce an augmented matrix, with the vector from the right hand side of the equation as the last column of the matrix. However, since the right hand side of the equation is the zero vector, row operations would have no effect on it. This tells us that if $A'$ is the row-reduced version of $A$, then the set of solutions to $Ax = \veco$ is the same as the set of solutions to $A'x = \veco$.\\
We have 2 free variables; call them $x_3$ and $x_4$. We can get solutions to our equation by choosing any values we like for $x_3$ and $x_4$, substituting, and solving for $x_1$ and $x_2$.  We get
$x_1 = -x_3 + 7x_4$ and $x_2 = x_3 - 6x_4$.  

Hence the general solution is \[
\left[ \begin{array}{c} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{array}\right] = 
\left[ \begin{array}{c} -x_3 + 7x_4 \\ x_3 - 6x_4 \\ x_3 \\ x_4 \end{array}\right] = 
x_3 \left[ \begin{array}{c} -1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] + 
x_4 \left[ \begin{array}{c} 7 \\ - 6 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right],
\]
for any $x_3,\x_4 \in \R$.  Hence the set of solutions is the span of  
$\left\{ \left[ \begin{array}{c} -1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]; 
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 7 \\ -6 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]\}.$

(Note that this is not the only list that spans the solution set, but it is the one that is simplest to find.)
