\beginedxtext{Definition of Linear Combination}

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$.  A {\keyb{\bf linear combination}} of a list of vectors $\{v_1; v_2; 
\ldots v_n\}$
in $V$ is a vector of the form $a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + \ldots + a_n v_n$, where the $a_i$ are scalars in $F$.

Can you write the vector $x  = \left[\begin{array}{c} -4 \\ -6  \\ -8 \end{array} \right]$

\edXsolution{ Notice how the grid of parallelograms shows us where we can expect to end up by applying $v_1$ and $v_2$ by various amounts; each lattice point is a linear combination, with integer coefficients, of $v_1$ and $v_2$. The question is, what combination of $v_1$ and $v_2$ gives us the same net effect as $w$? Since the head of $w$ lies on a lattice point of the grid, we can simply count our way to the answer: a movement of -1 spaces in the $v_1$ direction, and a movement of 2 spaces in the $v_2$ direction, takes us from the tail to the head of $w$.

Let $f$ denote the polynomial $t^3  + 1$, and let $g$ denote the

polynomial $t^2 - t$.  Recall that the set of polynomials is a vector space over $\R$, so $f$ and $g$
are vectors in that vector space.  

Let $h$ denote $17t^3 + 2t^2 - 2t + 17$.
Can you write $h$  as a linear combination $h = a_1 f + a_2 g$?  If so, enter possible values for $a_1$ and

\edXsolution{ 
For the first question, a little bit of trial and error gives us that $h = 17f + 2g$.  
% The coefficients of $h$ can be thought of as a vector: \\ \\ $v_h = \left[\begin{array}{c} 17 \\ 2  \\ -2 \\ 17 \end{array} \right]$. \\ \\ It may help to think the same way about the coefficients of $f$ and $g$, as vectors in $\R^4$: \\ \\ $v_f = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0  \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]$ and $v_g = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1  \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]$. \\ \\ 
% The question, then, is equivalent to asking if $v_h$ is a linear combination of $v_f$ and $v_g$. The zeros in $v_f$ and $v_g$ lead us to the solution; for example, because the first entry of $v_g$ is zero, and we need a combination of 17 for the first entry of $v_h$, we know that $a_1$ must be 17. (Analogously, because $g$ has no cubic term, and we need a combination of $17t^3$ for the first term of $h$, we know that 17 times the cubic term $t^3$ in $f$ is the only way to do the job.)
\\ \\ 
In the second problem, we are asked to combine $f$ and $g$ to make a polynomial with a quartic term (one that involves $t^4$). There is no way to multiply $f$ or $g$ by a scalar to get a quartic term.  It is true that 
$j = 3t\cdot f + 0g,$ but $3t$ is not a scalar.

We've fully row reduced the matrix; we see that the system is consistent and that $a_1 = -5$ and $a_2 = 2$.  
(Note also that we have no free variables; our solution, given by the right side of the augmented matrix, is unique.)

is in the span of $\{v_1; v_2; v_3; v_4 \}$.  Is $w \in \mathrm{Span}\{v_1; v_2; v_3; v_4 \}$?   

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}


\edXsolution{ 
The question is equivalent to asking about the consistency of a 
system of linear equations given by the following augmented matrix:
\\ \\ 
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & 3 \\ 1 & -1 & -2 & -5 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 3 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\ 
We will row reduce this matrix. Then we'll see if the row reduced augmented matrix represents a consistent system of equations. If so, then the above augmented matrix also represents a consistent system, and $w$ is in the span of the given set of vectors. \\ \\
Multiply the first row by -1, and add this to the second row:
\\ \\ 
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 & -3 & -2 \\ 0 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 3 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\ 
Multiply the second row by 2, and add this to the third row:
\\ \\ 
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 & -1 & -3 & -2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\
We could stop here. Our matrix now has 3 pivots for its 3 rows. It must represent a consistent system of equations. Here we will continue the process of row reduction, but only for the purpose of elucidating our claim.\\
Add the third row to the second row:
\\ \\
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & 3 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\
Add the third row to the first row:
\\ \\
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & -1 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\
For good measure, multiply the second row by -1:
\\ \\
$\left[\begin{array}{cccc:c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \end{array} \right]$
\\ \\
% The first three columns are now the identity matrix. Suppose we multiply the left side of our augmented matrix by our variable vector, in the manner of our original equation:
% \\ \\
% $\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \end{array} \right] \cdot \left[\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \\ a_4 \end{array} \right] =  \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]$
% \\ \\
% $\left[\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ a_2 + a_4 \\ a_3 + 2a_4 \end{array} \right] =  \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 3 \\ -1 \end{array} \right]$
% \\ \\
The above is consistent, as there is no row of all zeros followed by a non-zero in the right column. Therefore, $w$ is in the span of the given set of vectors. 
% \\ 
% We knew we were on our way to this result when we had a pivot in every row, because in such a case, we can continue to row reduce until our matrix contains $\mathbb{I}$ as a submatrix. At that point (just as above), our system will be consistent no matter what the right hand side is. We can conclude that the given set of vectors must span all of $\R^3$, and indeed, any matrix with m rows and m pivots must span all of $\R^m$.

Hence, in the augmented matrix,
 there can be no row of all zeros followed by a non-zero in the right-most column.  The system must be consistent, so $u$ is in $\mathrm{Span}\{v_1; v_2; v_3; v_4 \}$.  This will be true
